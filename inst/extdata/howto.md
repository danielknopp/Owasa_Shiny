## Interactive maps

The interactive maps show the mean annual values for each variable (either the *Cordex* projections [*P* and *T*], *P*, *E*, or *SM*). In the case of the *Cordex* projections, the mean annual values are calculated from 2006 to 2100, while in the case of *P*, *E*, and *SM*, the mean annual values are calculated from 1983 to 2021. The user can select a single point where data is available for visualisation purposes. To accomplish this, the user must select the *circlemarker* feature from the edition bar:

After this, the user can select a specific location.

## Cordex projections tab

In this tab, the user can visualise *Cordex* projections for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenatios for *P* and *T*. In this sense, the user can visualise the annual values of each variable from 2006 to 2100 and the seasonality of the selected variable for diverse periods (i.e., 2006-2020, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100).

## Products tab (*P*, *E*, and *SM*)
    
In these tabs, the user can visualise different hydroclimatological variables (i.e., *P*, *E*, and *SM*). After selecting a point, the user can visualise the annual values of the selected variable and product, and its respective seasonality over the 1983-2021 period.
