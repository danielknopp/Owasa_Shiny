## Background

The OWASA project supports local and regional decision-making towards water security and the management of hydro-meteorological extremes in Southern Africa. By developing (high-resolution) hydro-climatic, geospatial and socioeconomic data products, we aim to feed into site-specific water security and climate risk information and support the design of adequate climate adaptation measures. The project follows a multi-scale approach to link local, provincial and national stakeholders as well as African universities with the international research community.


Please have a look at the more detailed description of the <a href="http://www.basin-info.net/owasa" style="color: blue;">OWASA project</a>
and the <a href="http://www.basin-info.net/river-basins/limpopo-river-basin-southern-africa" style="color: blue;">study regions</a>.

OWASA will leverage multiple Earth observation products and global modelling efforts that are suitable for Southern Africa. The data products and information will help to characterise water security at the catchment scale. 
In summary, the OWASA Data Portal aims at:

<style>

</style>

* Offering an user friendly platform to showcase and share Southern African water security related information with stakeholders, academics and the public 
* Showing and comparing different climate products for precipitation (Baez et al, 2023) and temperature
* Showcasing locally useful open access data relevant for water security 
* Providing access to and retrieval of enhanced gridded climatological datasets developed specifically for OWASA sites
* Illustrating projected climatic conditions at the annual, seasonal and monthly scale using the CORDEX projections
* Show projected changes in annual precipitation volumes, in mean monthly/annual temperatures and their corresponding seasonal changes for different RCPs and different periods in the future.
* Presenting spatially distributed water security and drought risk related socioeconomic data 
* Providing interactive maps on spatially distributed water security and climate related risks for Southern Africa and the study regions in Zimbabwe and South Africa
