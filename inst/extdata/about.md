## Background

The OWASA-consortium aims to support local decision-making towards water security and drought risk management in Southern Africa by developing high-resolution datasets and information products at local scales that allow the selection of site-specific adaptation measures. This project is designed to follow a multi-scale approach to link local, provincial, and national stakeholders; university partners; and the international research community.

OWASA will leverage the availability of multiple Earth observation products and global modeling efforts to characterise water uses at the catchment scale to provide useful information that improves water security and drought risk assessments. For this purpose, multiple open access gridded hydro-climatic and socio-economic data products will be evaluated and further improved trough artificial intelligence methods using relevant in-situ information.

The resulting information will be used to design adequate cost-effective adaptation measures such as *i)* nature-based solutions; *ii)* combined green‐gray infrastructure; and **iii)** integrated water-energy-food (WEF) provision technologies (i.e. food-supply technologies, or irrigation concepts), alongside key local researchers and stakeholders. For this purpose, two pilot areas in Waterberg (South Africa) and Chimanimani (Zimbabwe) have been chosen in close coordination with the SADC integrated water resources management initiative UNESCO regional office for Southern Africa. These pilot areas, include UNESCO biosphere reserves, which provides a great opportunity to implement and monitor climate change adaptation strategies. The resulting knowledge obtained from these pilot regions will serve as best-practice examples for other areas within the same province, nation, or catchment. The further application of these strategies will be facilitated through appropriate communication and training activities.

The core German research partners of the OWASA project are the TH Köln and the TU Darmstadt. Both institutions have long term experience in diverse worldwide projects related to water security, while connections to leading local research institutions provide access to state-of-the-art expertise on Southern Africa. The ICWRGC will provide connection to the Global Terrestrial Network Hydrology GTNH and Southern Africa FRIEND‐Water network.

## Specific Objectives

**Definition phase:**

 - To establish a strong network of local stakeholders and universities that serve as a basis to implement upcoming phases.
 - To assess the knowledge, information, and data requirements of regional and local stakeholders.
 - Assess local challenges and the demand for water security-related knowledge and information. 
 
**Second phase:**

 - To develop a framework for assessing water security and drought risk in southern Africa.
 - To generate an online catalog of site-specific adaptation measures in the two pilot regions, which are characterised by high vulnerability to hydro‐climatic extremes and low level of water security [Waterberg (South Africa) and Chimanimani (Zimbabwe)].
 
The preparation of a detailed project work plan during the main phase (2023-2027) will also include a component for expanding the regional academic network by offering digital courses and webinars. This includes the training of young scientists (at the MSc and PhD level) from South Africa, Germany and Zimbabwe.
