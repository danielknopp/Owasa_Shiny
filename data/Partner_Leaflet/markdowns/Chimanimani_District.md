<center> <h4> Open Science to Support Local Water Security in Southern Africa </h4> </center>


## Background

The OWASA project supports local and regional decision-making towards water security and the management of hydro-meteorological extremes in Southern Africa. By developing (high-resolution) hydro-climatic, geospatial and socioeconomic data products, we aim to feed into site-specific water security and climate risk information and support the design of adequate climate adaptation measures. The project follows a multi-scale approach to link local, provincial and national stakeholders as well as African universities with the international research community.
